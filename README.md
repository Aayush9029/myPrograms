### What is face_rec? and How it works?

- It's basically a face recognition system (uses ML and opencv)

- First it  scans a persons face using webcam

- then it extracts the face data

- processes the face data and retrains a pretained model named ultra_light (from mfn)

- and lastly it uses the data to identify and recognize faces in the frame
