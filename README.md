### What is face_rec? and How it works?

> It's basically a face recognition system (uses ML and opencv)

> First it  scans a persons face using webcam

> then it extracts the face data

> processes the face data and retrains a pretained model named ultra_light (from mfn)

> and lastly it uses the data to identify and recognize faces in the frame
